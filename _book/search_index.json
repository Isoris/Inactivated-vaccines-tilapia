There is currently no existing formulation of vaccine that can protect the fish against S.agalactiae and A.veronii, two major fish pathogens, at once. Prophylaxis treatments for cultured fish must be cheap and convenient to use, as well as efficient and durable. Oil-based formalin-killed vaccines score all criteria. They are convenient for small and medium scale aquaculture production systems. 1.1.1 Freshwater aquaculture is suceptible to microbial pathogens Two pathogens, S.agalactiae and A.veronii are the etiological agent of bacterial infections in freshwater cultured fish. They can be found all over the globe, with reported outbreaks in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. They induce mass mortality of the infected fish within a few days. The two bacterial isolates used in this research are coming from Thailand and were gifted by Dr.Ha Thanh Dong. Those isolates are highly pathogenic and their presence may create substantial economic loss for the farmers.In Thailand, freshwater fish culture is of first importance for the economy and for the food safety. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the most produced fish and represent almost 50% of the total freshwater fish production for Thailand. However it is also the most touched by infections from S.agalactiae and A.veronii. The proportions of fish species cultured are in the figure below: Figure 1.1: Proportion of freshwater fish species farmed in Thailand. Adapted from: Dr Nopadon Pirarat My master research at the Asian Institute of Technology aims to study Nile tilapias immune response to the whole bacteria killed vaccines and prove that 1) vaccines are efficient 2) can immunize against the two bacteria in a single dose. "],["research-context.html", "Chapter 2 Research context", " Chapter 2 Research context The following questions will be answered in their corresponding sections. Research questions: Is the vaccine effective? How much protection does the vaccines offer to the fish? Are single formulations (monovalent) as effective as a combination (bivalent)? Is a booster dose any necessary/useful? Details about the experiment: What species/strain of fish? How old are the individuals? How much beneficial can be the vaccination for aquaculture? What are the characteristics of the pathogens used in the vaccine? Where does the experiment takes place? What are the factors and variables to consider? What tests will be performed and why? Who is in charge of carrying the experiments? When? What are the majors risks and challenges? Is the experiment reproducible?, what are the limitations?
