**Fighting infections** from the bacteria *Streptococcus agalactiae* and *Aeromonas veronii* **in Nile tilapia** (*Oreochromis niloticus*) is a **hot-topic** research for aquaculture. Both bacteria are cosmopolite and are causing high mortality in infected ponds. Moreover, a diseased fish, if consumed raw can easily become a vector for the transmission to animals and/or humans. Prophylactic measures such as fish **vaccination** are a specific and very **effective way of prevention** from diseases. In the present study, we aim to demonstrate that immunization is possible in Tilapia. By using **inactivated vaccines** prepared from formalin-killed pathogens, we were able to produce **two monovalent vaccines** from *Streptococcus agalactiae* and from *Aeromonas veronii*, **and a bivalent vaccine** from the combination of the two pathogens with a ratio of 1:1. **Four-hundred and eighty juveniles** were acclimated  and split into **4 groups** in separate aquariums for **vaccination**: 1 control (Ct) and 3 treatments (Sa, Av, Sa+Av) at (day 0). A second **booster** will be administrated **3 weeks later** (day 21) for **only half of the fish**. From the first day of vaccination, 8 individuals per group were selected for sampling weekly. Immune response, both systemic and mucosal was characterized for humoral immunity using concentrations in Immunoglobulins M as the immunogenic marker with the help of ELISA assays or agglutination antibody test and by RT-PCR for IgM gene transcription activity before, during and after immunization on a weekly basis. Finally, the **fish** subgroups **vaccinated once** only have undergone a **first bacterial challenge** at 4 weeks (day 28). The **other half** which received the **booster** was **challenged after 12 weeks** with a single lethal dose of *Streptococcus agalactiae* or *Aeromonas veronii*, respective of their vaccinations. Variability of the survival rates in each group is a direct consequence of vaccination.

## Background {-}

In order to sustain an intensified and resilient Cichlids' aquaculture model, many research units and private companies around the world are studying immune responses of fish against viral and bacterial infections and are developing vaccines. There is currently no existing formulation of vaccine that can protect the fish against S.agalactiae and A.veronii, two major fish pathogens, at once. Prophylaxis treatments for cultured fish must be accessible and convenient to use, as well as efficient and durable. Oil-based formalin-killed vaccines score all the criteria. They are convenient for small and medium scale aquaculture production systems.


### Freshwater cultured fish are prone to microbial pathogens {-}

Two pathogens, S.agalactiae and A.veronii are the etiological agent of bacterial infections in freshwater cultured fish. They can be found all over the globe, with reported outbreaks in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. They induce mass mortality of the infected fish within a few days. The two bacterial isolates used in this research are from Thailand.. Those isolates are highly pathogenic and their presence may create substantial economic loss for the farmers.In Thailand, freshwater fish culture is of first importance for the economy and for the food safety. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the most produced fish and represent almost 50% of the total freshwater fish production for Thailand. However it is also the most touched by infections from S.agalactiae and A.veronii. The proportions of fish species cultured are in the figure below:

My master research at the Asian Institute of Technology aims to study Nile tilapia's immune response to the whole bacteria killed vaccines and prove that 1) vaccines are efficient 2) can immunize against the two bacteria in a single dose.

## Conceptual framework

<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='\\textwidth', fig.cap="Conceptual framework"}
knitr::include_graphics("conceptualframework-1.png")
```

In the initiation phase, the review of the existing literature on vaccination using inactivated vaccines, antibody response and immunology of cichlids was performed. In the planning phase, the list of raw materials was assessed and the methology used was defined: ponds preparation, the fish feeding regime, protocols for bacterial culture, protocol for candidate vaccine development, protocols for fish mucus swabs and blood sampling, protocols for antibody agglutination titration, ELISA, RT-PCR and the protocol for challenge tests. During the execution phase, the fish immune responses after vaccination by each of three candidate vaccines was monitored and associated relevant data were collected. The challenge test in vivo has been performed twice after vaccination (once after first dose, once after booster dose). The results of all the experiments are presented in the final master thesis paper. Finally, during the project closing phase, I have drawn conclusions from the compared vaccines efficiencies. And I have given recommendations on best vaccination protocol to provide the best protection against the two bacterial strains S.agalactiae and A.veronii.

## Experimental design

```{r include=FALSE}
library(edibble)
spdes <- start_design("Experimental design for treatments (with control groups)") %>% 
  set_units(Group_fish_n120_ = 4,
            virtual_subgroup_n60_ = nested_in(Group_fish_n120_, 2)) %>% 
  set_trts(Vaccine_type_bacterial_strain = c("Control","Sa","Av","Sa+Av"),
           Vaccine_dose_nbr   = c("Unique", "Booster")) %>% 
  allocate_trts(Vaccine_type_bacterial_strain ~ Group_fish_n120_, 
                Vaccine_dose_nbr  ~ virtual_subgroup_n60_) %>% 
  randomise_trts()
plot(spdes)
plot(spdes, view = "low")
```

### Vaccination split-plot

The vaccination will be different for the 4 experimental groups. Each group will consist of approximately 120 individuals. Therefore, the 4 groups will be kept separately in 4 medium aquaria. The first dose will be given to all individuals in each group with either (Control, Sa, Av, Sa+Av). The second dose of vaccination (booster) will be given 3 weeks later (21 days after the end of the acclimatation of the fish to their experimental aquarium).

#### High level view (vaccination) {-}

The fish can be vaccinated with only one of the four vaccine type (Control, Sa, Av, Sa+Av). Four treatment groups of 120 individuals are therefore be created. Half of the fish (n=60) for each group will receive or not a second dose (8 subgroups). The two treatments (variables) are therefore the type of vaccine and the number of doses injected.<br/>
<br/>
```{r, fig.cap="Experimental design for fish vaccination (high level)", echo=FALSE, out.width='\\textwidth'}
knitr::include_graphics("vaccination-high.png")
```

#### Low level view (vaccination) {-}

The fish can be vaccinated with only one of the four vaccine type (Control, Sa, Av, Sa+Av). Four treatment groups of 120 individuals are therefore be created (in blue). Half of the fish (n=60) for each group will receive the second dose (subgroups in yellow). The fish that were not randomly selected to get the second dose of vaccine (booster) will be transferred to smaller aquaria prior to the first challenge test (week 4).

```

### Sampling split-plot

The sampling consists in the extraction of fish mucus and blood. The designs are shown below.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
set.seed(2020) 
spdes <- start_design("Experimental design for treatments (with control groups)") %>% 
  set_units(Group_fish_n120_ = 4,
            Samping_week_n_ = nested_in(Group_fish_n120_, 12)) %>% 
  set_trts(Vaccine_type_bacterial_strain = c("Control","Sa","Av","Sa+Av"),
           Sampling_tissue_origin   = c("Blood", "Mucus")) %>%
  allocate_trts(Vaccine_type_bacterial_strain ~ Group_fish_n120_, 
                Sampling_tissue_origin  ~ Samping_week_n_) %>% 
  randomise_trts()
plot(spdes)
plot(spdes, view = "low")
```

#### High level view (sampling) {-}

There are 4 experimental groups (the treatments) corresponding to 4 clusters. Each single group will be sampled for mucus and blood weekly during 12 weeks. <br/>
<br/>
```{r, fig.cap="Experimental design for fish blood and mucus sampling (high level)", echo=FALSE , out.width='\\textwidth'}
knitr::include_graphics("sampling-high.png")
```

#### Low level view (sampling) {-}

In total there will be 48 unique samplings (4 groups* 12 weeks). The samples will be obtained by extracting mucus and blood from 8  individuals (8 individuals to obtain the final volume). In total 384 random individuals will be sampled. One individual can be sampled twice but not the same week. There are 4 experimental groups are forming 4 clusters of arrows. <br/>
