Aquaculture and Aquatic Resources Management, Asian Institute of Technology, Pathum Thani, Thailand 2021-09-13 Front matter body { text-align: justify} Fighting infections from the bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas veronii in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a hot-topic research for aquaculture. Both bacteria are cosmopolite and are causing high mortality in infected ponds. Moreover, a diseased fish, if consumed raw can easily become a vector for the transmission to animals and/or humans. Prophylactic measures such as fish vaccination are a specific and very effective way of prevention from diseases. In the present study, we aim to demonstrate that immunization is possible in Tilapia. By using inactivated vaccines prepared from formalin-killed pathogens, we were able to produce two monovalent vaccines from Streptococcus agalactiae and from Aeromonas veronii, and a bivalent vaccine from the combination of the two pathogens with a ratio of 1:1. six-hundred and sixty juveniles were acclimated and split into 4 groups in separate aquaria for the first vaccination: 1 control (Ct) and 3 treatments (Sa, Av, Sa+Av) at (day 0). A second booster will be administrated 3 weeks later (day 21) for only half of the fish. From the first day of vaccination, 8 individuals per group** were selected for sampling weekly. Immune response, both systemic and mucosal was characterized for humoral immunity using concentrations in Immunoglobulins M obtained by ELISA and agglutination antibody titer test. In addition, 3 individuals were sacrified each week to provide tissues of head kidneys and liver for IgM gene expression analysis via RT-PCR before, during and after immunization. Prior to the second vaccination, on week 3 (21 days), half of the fish of each group was moved into 12 laboratory aquaria for a future first bacterial challenge at 4 weeks (day 28). The other half of the fish, which received the second vaccination was moved in 12 laboratory aquaria at 12 weeks post vaccination and challenged a week later. Briefly, the challenge is an intra peritoneal injection of a single lethal dose of Streptococcus agalactiae or Aeromonas veronii, respective of the vaccination of the fish. Variability of the survival rates in each challenge group is a direct consequence of vaccination.

There is currently no existing formulation of vaccine that can protect the fish against S.agalactiae and A.veronii, two major fish pathogens, at once. Prophylaxis treatments for cultured fish must be accessible and convenient to use, as well as efficient and durable. Oil-based formalin-killed vaccines score all the criteria. They are convenient for small and medium scale aquaculture production systems. Freshwater cultured fish are prone to microbial pathogens Two pathogens, S.agalactiae and A.veronii are the etiological agent of bacterial infections in freshwater cultured fish. They can be found all over the globe, with reported outbreaks in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. They induce mass mortality of the infected fish within a few days. The two bacterial isolates used in this research are from Thailand.. Those isolates are highly pathogenic and their presence may create substantial economic loss for the farmers.In Thailand, freshwater fish culture is of first importance for the economy and for the food safety. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the most produced fish and represent almost 50% of the total freshwater fish production for Thailand. However it is also the most touched by infections from S.agalactiae and A.veronii. The proportions of fish species cultured are in the figure below: Figure 1.1: Proportion of freshwater fish species farmed in Thailand. Adapted from: Dr Nopadon Pirarat My master research at the Asian Institute of Technology aims to study Nile tilapias immune response to the whole bacteria killed vaccines and prove that 1) vaccines are efficient 2) can immunize against the two bacteria in a single dose.

In the planning phase, the list of raw materials was assessed and the methology used was defined: ponds preparation, the fish feeding regime, protocols for bacterial culture, protocol for candidate vaccine development, protocols for fish mucus swabs and blood sampling, protocols for antibody agglutination titration, ELISA, RT-PCR and the protocol for challenge tests. During the execution phase, the fish immune responses after vaccination by each of three candidate vaccines was monitored and associated relevant data were collected. The challenge test in vivo has been performed twice after vaccination (once after first dose, once after booster dose). The results of all the experiments are presented in the final master thesis paper. Finally, during the project closing phase, I have drawn conclusions from the compared vaccines efficiencies. And I have given recommendations on best vaccination protocol to provide the best protection against the two bacterial strains S.agalactiae and A.veronii. 3.2 Split of the work in workpackages The work packages have been defined in order to split the research work in a list of tasks. Figure 3.2: Work packages and tasks 3.3 Workflow Figure 3.3: Work packages tasks flow chart 3.4 Experimental designs Vaccination The vaccination will be different for each of 4 experimental groups. Each group will include approximately 165 individuals kept in 4 medium aquaria/ponds. The first dose of vaccine will be given to all individuals in each group (Control, Sa, Av, Sa+Av). The second dose of vaccination (booster) will be given 3 weeks later (21 days after the end of the acclimatation of the fish to their experimental aquarium), again to each 4 groups. Sampling The sampling is done weekly for 12 weeks. It consists in the analysis of gene expressions levels by RT-PCR. To do so 3 animals of each group are scarified every week in order to obtain head kidney tissue and liver tissue. Moreover, 8 different animals are sampled blood and mucus but not killed.

The important variables and values to record for the culture of bacteria in for microbiology experiments are cell forming unts(CFU)/mL, time of inoculation, biomass(turbidity, light scattering by OD600 on a spectrophotometer), and the cell count(number/ml). Cell forming unts(CFU)/mL is a semi quantitative measure of the ability of a bacterial solution to create colonies. A bacterial colony on a petri dish/plate can only develop from a single viable bacteria, therefore it does not count the dead cells and the liquid phase of the bacterial solution from which the bacteria originates. In our project, our goal is to produce a solution containing antigenic particles from the bacteria. Our vaccine will contain whole killed bacteria that will be recognized by the fish immune system. The vaccine also contains bacterial debris and soluble bacterial antigenic bio molecules recognized by the fish immune system as well. Therefore the total amount of antigens in our inactivated vaccine is also the combination of live bacteria, dead bacteria, and bacterial debris/particles. As explained previously, cell forming unts(CFU)/mL is a count of concentration in live bacteria in the bacterial solution. It is possible to count the dead bacteria and approximate the number of total cells (dead and live) precisely by counting the cells using hemocytometer plate. 6.1.1 Generation of microbial growth-curves according to OD600 (=600 nm) In order to understand how our two strains grow on our media, we need to generate microbial growth curves according to OD600 values for each strain. The growth curves are specific of the temperature, the composition of the culture medium and of the spectrophotometer. It is possible to normalize them when we use a new spectrophotometer if we have an older growth curve and the same culture medium and temperature. Instrument calibration is necessary if you like to compare OD600 values between different photometers as measurements of turbidity vary greatly depending on the optical setup of each device. Arrangement of optical parts of the photometer influence light scattering in many ways, resulting in different readings even for two instruments of the same type. OD600 values should not be considered as absorbance because microbial cells scatter light depending on size and shape and usually do not absorb light. The resulting factor can be used to multiply OD600 values of one instrument and compare them with another. When using a photometer without an automated blanking function, we must measure the corresponding empty culture media at 600 nm and enter OD600 values (replicates 1 - 5) for buffer solution of instrument 1 and 2 in fields B4 - B8 and D4 - D8, respectively. Then, we measure grown cell culture at 600 nm and enter measured OD600 values (replicates 1 - 5) for instrument 1 and 2 in fields C4 - C8 and E4 - E8, respectively.If we are using a photometer with an automated blanking function, we blank the instruments with corresponding culture media first, then we measure grown cell culture at 600 nm. We nter OD600 values for instrument 1 and 2 in fields I4 - I8 and J4 - J8, respectively. We can use calculated instrument factor to compare measured OD600 values for cell culture growth between instrument 1 and 2 of future experiments, respectively. For the formulation of the inactivated bacterial vaccines, the bacteria will be put in culture in a volume of around 300mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) or in (TSA) for at least a day 24 h at 30C under agitation et oxygenation. The bacteria will develop and multiply at regular interval, 1 becomes 2 which divides to form 4 (2^2) then 2^3 2^4 2^5 2^6 and so on. The growth follow 3 general trends named phases.

Those assays will allow us to demonstrate that there is indeed an effect of the vaccines on immune response in the animals. The three assays will help to quantify this effect by measuring the activation of the main components of the adaptive/humoral immune system and their kinetics (the activity over time). 9.1 ELISA for IgM and IgT ELISA is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibodies, antigens, proteins and glycoproteins in biological samples. ELISA technique is widely used for rapid diagnostic tests such as the diagnosis of HIV infection, pregnancy tests or the detection of food allergens. The principle of this technique is based on the use of an enzyme conjugated to an antibody which by reacting with a colorless substrate gives a colored reaction product and which is therefore detectable. This is called a chromogenic substrate. Different enzymes are used for ELISA tests including alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or beta-galactosidase. The ELISA assay will provide informations on the Ab titer of the fish, IgM and IgT respectively are targets in the assay. 9.2 PCR of key immune genes Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique using 1) reverse-transcription (RNA into DNA) (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and 2) amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Freeman et al.,1999). It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined RT-PCR and qPCR are routinely used for analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings. 9.2.1 Normalization of gene expression for RT-PCR Choosing the suitable reference gene is critical for normalizing target genes expression in qPCR. Wang et al. (2015) selected for O.niloticus, six commonly used endogenous controls as candidate reference genes to evaluate and analyze their expression levels, stabilities and normalization to the immune-related gene IgM expression during vaccination and infection in spleen of tilapia with RefFinder and GeNorm programs with very good results. The six reference genes for RT-PCR of O.niloticus are genes ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in the animal. They are also well known as house-keeping genes/mRNAs. (see below).
